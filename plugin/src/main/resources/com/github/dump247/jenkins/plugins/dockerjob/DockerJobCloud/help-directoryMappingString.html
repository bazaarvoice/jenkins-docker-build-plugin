    Map directories from the host machine into the slave container. The container directory does
    not need to exist. If it does, the mapping will override the existing directory.
</p>

<p>
    The format is <em>/host:/slave[:access]</em>, where <em>access</em> determines what access the
    container has to the directory. The value can be <em>ro</em> for read-only or <em>rw</em> for
    read and write access.
</p>

<p>
    Each line contains a separate directory mapping. Empty lines and lines that start with
    <em>#</em> are ignored.
