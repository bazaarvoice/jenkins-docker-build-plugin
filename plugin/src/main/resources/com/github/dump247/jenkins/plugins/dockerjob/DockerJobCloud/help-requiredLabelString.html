    Labels for the nodes in this cloud, with the additional property that the label MUST appear in
    the job's condition label for the job to run in the cloud. This enforces that the cloud must
    be explicitly selected by the job, rather than implicitly selected.

<p>
    For example, a cloud for slaves running in a QA environment could have a required label of
    <code>env/qa</code>. If a job does not include the <code>env/qa</code> in it's condition string,
    the job will not be run in the QA environment. A job with the condition string
    <code>foo &amp;&amp; bar</code> would never run in the QA cloud. However, a job with the
    condition string <code>foo &amp;&amp; bar &amp;&amp; env/qa</code> could (since it includes the
    label <code>env/qa</code>), assuming the other parts of the expression match.
