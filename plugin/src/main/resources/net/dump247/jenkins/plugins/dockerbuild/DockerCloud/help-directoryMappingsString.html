<p>
    Bind directories from the host machine to paths in the container. If the parent directories do
    not exist in the container, they will be created. If a directory already exists with the same
    path in the container, the host directory will be mounted at the given path and will hide the
    original directory on the container filesystem.
</p>

<p>
    A directory can be mapped read-only. The files will still display the same permissions as the
    host system, but any write attempts will fail.
</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>
    Blank lines and lines that start with a <code>#</code> are ignored. Default access is read-only.
