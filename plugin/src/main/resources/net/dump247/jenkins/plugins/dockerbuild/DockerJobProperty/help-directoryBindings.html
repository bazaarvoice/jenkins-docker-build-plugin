        Map directory on host machine (machine running the jenkins agent) to a path in
        the docker container.
    </p>
    <p>
        Format: <i>hostPath[:containerPath[:access]]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>hostPath</i> is the path on the jenkins agent to map into the container.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>containerPath</i> is the path to map to in the container. If not specified,
        the <i>hostPath</i> is used. The directory does not need to exist in the container
        image. It will be created if needed. If the path already exists, the new file system
        will hide the existing directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>access</i> determines the access the container has to the mapped directory.
        Can be <b>r</b> for read-only and <b>rw</b> for read-write. Default is read-write.
    </p>
    <p>
        Blank lines or lines that start with # are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environment variables from the jenkins agent can be referenced in the host or container paths with
        <i>${VARIABLE}</i> or <i>${env.VARIABLE}</i>. System properties from the jenkins agent can be referenced in
        the host or container paths with <i>${sys.variable}</i>.
    </p>

        Examples:
        <div style="white-space:pre; font-family: monospace">
    # Same as /host/path:/host/path:rw
    /host/path

    # Same as /host/path:/host/path:r
    /host/path::r

    # Same as /host/path:/container/path:rw
    /host/path:/container/path

    # Makes /container/path read-only for the container
    /host/path:/container/path:r
        </div>
